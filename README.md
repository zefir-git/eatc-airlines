## Commands

### `fetch`

Fetch flight data for an airport using [AirNav Radar](https://airnavradar.com). This command retrieves flights up to
approximately 7 days in the past.

**Example:**

```sh
eatc-airlines fetch EGLL lhr.json
```

### `gen`

After fetching flight data, use this command to generate an `airlines` configuration for your airports in an EndlessATC
custom airspace.

**Example:**

```sh
eatc-airlines gen lhr.json /path/to/output.json ../directory/
```

You can specify multiple files and directories as inputs.

Alternatively, you can manually copy the commandâ€™s standard output into your custom airspace file.

If you encounter warnings about missing airline callsigns in the standard error output, please consider opening a pull
request or reporting an issue, if appropriate.
